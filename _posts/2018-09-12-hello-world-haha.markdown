You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

<pre><code class="csharp">
namespace HelloWolrd
{
    public class HelloWolrd
    {
        public HelloWolrd()
        {
            // ctor
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Introduce yourself to other
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="yourName">your name</param>
        public void SayHello(string yourName)
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine($"Hello,everyone, My name is {yourName}");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
